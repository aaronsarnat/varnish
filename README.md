# Varnish

A library of AI2 themed React components.

## Includes

* Custom theme provider for both [Ant Design](https://ant.design) and [Styled-Components](https://www.styled-components.com/).
* Common AI2 Styled-Components, components, and utilities.

## Peer Dependencies

Varnish has several peer dependencies which you should install for things to work correctly. You can find them [here](https://github.com/allenai/varnish/blob/master/ui/package.json#L34).

## Installation

* NPM:

    ```bash
    npm install @allenai/varnish
    ```

* or Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn add @allenai/varnish
    ```

## Usage

1. Basic
    ```html
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    // Import the parts of Varnish you want. At minimum, you need to import the ThemeProvider
    import { ThemeProvider } from '@allenai/varnish/theme';

    // Wrap your App with the Varnish ThemeProvider
    const VarnishApp =  () => (
      <ThemeProvider>
        <App />
      </ThemeProvider>
    )

    // Render
    ReactDOM.render(<VarnishApp />, document.getElementById('root'));
    ```

## Contributing the Varnish

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:allenai/varnish.git

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

1. For contributors external to AI2, make a fork and request a pr from that fork

1. For contributors internal to AI2, please request access rights by contacting REVIZ, then make a pr for your updated branch

1. Build and publish NPM (will be done via google soon, but for now)

    1. Update the package.json version field appropriately and create a git commit and tag for the version

        ```bash
        npm version major|minor|patch
        ```

    1. Publish the tag to github

        ```bash
        git push --tags
        ```

    1. Build the lib

        ```bash
        yarn build
        ```

    1. Move lib files to dist folder

        ```bash
        yarn prepare-npm
        ```

    1. Publish to npm from the dist folder

        ```bash
        npm publish --access public ./dist
        ```

# Built on the skiff-template

[skiff](https://github.com/allenai/skiff) template

An application that includes:
* A Python based, [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) HTTP server responsible for
  serving static assets and dynamic API endpoints.
* A [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
  and [Varnish](http://github.com/allenai/varnish) based user interface.
* Automatic deploys to shared infrastructure and other functionality provided by
  [skiff](https://github.com/allenai/skiff).

## Getting Started

Start by making sure that you've installed the latest version of [Docker üê≥](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

After downloading [the latest version of the template](https://github.com/allenai/skiff-template/releases/latest)
and unpacking it, you'll need to make one small change before it's ready
to be deployed:

Open `.skiff/config.json` in the text editor of your choice and update the
`appName` and `contact` fields:

* The `appName` field should be a short, unique and url-safe identifier for
  your application ‚Äî keep in mind that your application will be accessed by
  end users by going to `${appName}.apps.allenai.org` in a browser.
* The `contact` field should be the `@allenai.org` email address that is
  responsible for the demo. Don't include the `@allenai.org` portion,
  just the prefix (i.e. don't change it to `sams@allenai.org`, just use `sams`).

After doing so, start a local webserver like so:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

When you run `docker-compose up --build`, the following occurs:

1. We built container images from `server/Dockerfile` and `ui/Dockerfile`.
   Cached layers will be used where appropriate.

2. We start both the services.

3. We mount the `server/` and `ui/` directories from your host machine into
   the that of the running container. This means that you should be careful
   about making updates to the associated `Dockerfile`s, as the files in
   your local files will overwrite anything that lives in the mounted
   paths.

You'll see logs from two processes:

* `server`: Your Python application server, where you can define API
  endpoints.
* `ui`: The UI portion of your application.

Things might take a moment to startup at first, but once they do open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser of your choice.

The running application will update as you make changes to the code. Keep an
eye on the terminal for build errors if they occur.

If at any point one of the processes dies due to an error, you can bring things
back up by killing the process and re-executing `docker-compose up --build`.

Sometimes `docker-compose` itself fails to cleanup the running processes when
you kill the parent process. When this happens use `docker-compose down` to
gracefully shut things down.

Your application won't be deployed [until you've been fully onboarded](https://github.com/allenai/skiff/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new%2C+onboarding&template=request-access-to-skiff.md&title=Ahoy%2C+I%27d+like+to+come+onboard%21).
You'll hear from us once that's the case.

## Installing Third Party Packages

You'll likely want to install third party packages at some point. To do so
follow the steps described below for the target environment.

### Python Dependencies

To add new dependencies to the Python portion of the project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your local environment is running (i.e. you've ran `docker-compose up`).
2. Start a shell session in the server container:
    ```
    ./bin/sh server
    ```
3. Install the dependency in question:
    ```
    pip install <dependency>
    ```
4. Update the dependency manifest:
    ```
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
5. Exit the container:
    ```
    exit
    ```

At this point the `requirements.txt` file should've been updated. Commit and
push the file as you would otherwise to persist the changes.

### UI Dependencies

To add new dependencies to the UI, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your local environment is running (i.e. you've ran `docker-compose up`).
2. Start a shell session in the ui container:
    ```
    ./bin/sh ui
    ```
3. Install the dependency in question:
    ```
    yarn add <dependency>
    ```
4. Exit the container:
    ```
    exit
    ```
At this point the `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files should've been updated.

## Deploying

Your application is automatically deployed as you push changes to Github:

* Updating the `master` branch updates the staging environment, which is
  accessible at `<your-repo-name>.staging.apps.allenai.org`. This environment
  should be used to verify changes before releasing them to a wide audience.
* Updating the `release` branch updates the production environment, which is
  accessible at `<your-repo-name>.apps.allenai.org`. This environment should
  be updated more selectively, and is the url you can share with external users
  once you're ready to do so.

Remember, *all* environments are public. The staging environments are only
hidden from the outside world in that their urls are slightly less discoverable.

Don't publish anything that isn't appropriate for a public audience. If you
require finer grained access control, ask the [reviz team](mailto:reviz@allenai.org)
for help in setting this up.
